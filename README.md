# React Playground

This repository is meant to be used as a template for quick React.js experiments and little apps. Why?

- I enjoy doing little experiments
- I don't enjoy online editors/playgrounds
- I don't enjoy create-react-app

## Developing

- Install Node.js v15.14.x
- Run `npm install`
- To start the dev server: `npm run dev`
- To run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
- To run end to end tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- To open the interactive cypress app: `npm run test:e2e:open`
